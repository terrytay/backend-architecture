# Backend Architecture

---

For starters, do consider going to [Microsoft Typescript Node Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) first.

This project was created to be able to scaffold backend servers quickly. Clean architecture has been used extensively.
Let me know in the issues if there are things which can be improved on.
